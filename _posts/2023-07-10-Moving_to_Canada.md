<div align="justify"> With my PhD coming to a close at the end of 2022, my partner and I made the big decision to move to Canada.</div>

<div align="justify"> The hardest part was adapting to the cold weather, from 35 to 40 degrees Celsius in Perth to -10 degrees Celsius in Toronto. The first purchases were a big coat, warm boots and gloves!</div> 

## Below are some pictures of the winter.

<div align="justify"> After submitting my Thesis, I was successful in securing a Postdoctoral position at Toronto Rehab Hospital, the University Health Network.</div>

<div align="justify"> The weather has begun to warm up, thankfully. This has made exploring the city and its surroundings a little easier. We went out to Centre Island. The below picture is the view of the city from the island. It was amazing!</div>

<div align="justify"> We also headed north to Lake Country around Huntsville, about two and a half hours north of Toronto. The area is absolutely beautiful!</div>

Some other great summer activities are going to a Baseball game at the Rogers Centre (the footlong hotdogs are a hit), and Sailing out on the Lake.</div>
