title: About me
---
Hi, my name is Thomas Walden. I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University Health Network, Toronto. My position is within the KITE Research Institute at the Lyndhurst Centre, focusing on movement rehabilitation for individuals with a spinal cord injury.

I completed my Ph.D. in Exercise Science at Murdoch University, Perth, Western Australia. My primary Ph.D. research investigated the biomechanical and physiological implications of lower limb blood flow restriction during treadmill walking. Relocating to Toronto in November 2022, I secured a postdoctoral research fellowship within the Craven Lab at Lyndhurst Rehabilitation Centre. Currently, my research focuses on implementing exoskeletons as a rehabilitation tool for individuals with an SCI/D, understanding independence post-rehabilitation discharge for individuals living with an SCI/D, and developing wearable technology to track movement patterns in older adults living with osteoporosis as a falls prevention strategy. My primary career goal is to develop novel training interventions to help remove participation barriers, allowing all individuals access to exercise’s health and fitness benefits.
