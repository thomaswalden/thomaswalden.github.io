title: About me
---
Hi, my name is Thomas Walden. I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University Health Network, Toronto. My position is within the KITE Research Institute at the Lyndhurst Centre, focusing on movement rehabilitation for individuals with a spinal cord injury.

Having received my Ph.D. in Kinesiology, my focus has now turned to pursuing an academic career in rehabilitation science, which will prioritize research, teaching, and mentoring. Building upon the skills acquired during my Ph.D., my Postdoctoral position has allowed me to work alongside clinicians at the largest spinal cord injury rehabilitation facility in Canada. This experience has exposed me to complex populations, including multiple levels of neurological dysfunction and its associated comorbidities and older adults at risk of a falls event. Currently, I am involved in a first-in-human study looking at the feasibility of implementing exoskeletons into spinal cord rehabilitation programs. I am also leading the development of a new wearable technology that can identify compromising movement patterns that can instigate a life-altering fall event for an older adult, bringing together academics, clinicians and an industry partner. I am also leading a collaboration with PRAXIS, the largest database that tracks the daily experiences of individuals living with a spinal cord injury. These projects will further my academic journey in biomechanics and cardio-metabolic rehabilitation. I firmly believe combining these specialized fields holds immense potential to advance our understanding of how human movement can affect cardio-metabolic health and vice versa in neurological disorders and aging. As the rehabilitation discipline evolves, research must also adapt, tackling new questions to find innovative ways to offer therapies that improve health, and I am committed to evolving the discipline.

## Teaching Philosophy
The majority of my teaching experience has been within a classroom setting across numerous undergraduate courses, including Biomechanics, Human Physiology, Exercise Rehabilitation, Strength and Conditioning, Sport and Exercise Psychology, and Research Methodologies. I strongly believe in creating a safe and comfortable environment that allows students the opportunity to discuss the topics at hand. Interacting with their peers, explaining and listening to course content from many points of view facilitates a unique learning experience that fosters the beginning of a solid foundation of understanding. The idea stems from the convention of classroom autonomy, giving students a choice in discussion topics and direction, leading to substantially higher classroom participation. I also find that this technique quickly highlights areas that require additional focus, generating class content and discussion points for the following weeks, which directly focus on the needs of the specific class.

As a part of my role as a Ph.D. Candidate and Postdoctoral Fellow, I have had the opportunity to mentor undergraduate, masters, and Ph.D. level students. In these 1:1 situations, I take on the mentality of the age-old saying, 'Give a person a fish they eat for a day – teach them to fish, and they eat for life.' Providing sufficient resources, directed guidance, and clear expectations helps develop vital critical thinking skills, allowing these students to navigate specific issues that may arise during their research journey. I also believe this teaching process entices students to become lifelong learners in their chosen field. My priority is to help these junior researchers find their individual and unique voices for how they will pass on their skills and research findings in the future.
