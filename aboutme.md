title: About me
---
<div align="justify">Hi, my name is Thomas Walden, and I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University Health Network, Toronto. My position is within the KITE Research Institute at the Lyndhurst Centre, focusing on movement rehabilitation for individuals with spinal cord injuries.</div>


<div align="justify">I completed my Ph.D (currently in review) at Murdoch University, focusing on Biomechanics and Exercise Physiology. Thesis Title - Physiological and Biomechanical Responses to Blood Flow Restricted Walking in Young Adults. My thesis looked to add further information to the blood flow restriction field, highlighting potential safety concerns that could arise when exercise professionals prescribe the technique for individuals that already exhibit numerous risk factors for exercise. I am passionate about making exercise as inclusive as possible. With that, my main goal in research is to investigate all avenues that can help remove barriers, allowing all individuals access to the health and fitness benefits that exercise can offer.</div>

### Teaching
As a part of my role as a PhD candidate I conduct lectures, tutorials, and laboratories for current undergraduate students. Within this role, I work closely with the unit coordinator to develop content and teaching aids with the goal to make our units as engaging and inclusive as possible. In addition to teaching, I am responsible for responding to student emails and unit-related administration, assessing student’s written assignments and practical assessments, and developing and grading end-of-semester examinations.

Due to the recent COVID-19 lockdowns, I adapted unit content to be delivered both face to face, as well as through an online teaching system (blackboard collaborate). With the snap lockdowns that we experienced in Western Australia, I had to be ready to teach in person one week and online the next. This meant taking practical hands-on units and being able to deliver them effectively in an online setting. In addition, all in-person assessments and exams needed to be redeveloped so they could also be performed online if needed, while still meeting the requirements of the accrediting body of the Exercise Science degree, Exercise and Sport Science Australia.

**Teaching Units**
 - Introduction to Research Methodology
 - Biomechanics 
 - Strength and Conditioning
 - Human Physiology
 - Exercise Rehabilitation
 - Sport and Exercise Psychology 

**Kulbardi Aboriginal Centre Tutoring**
   
Since february 2020, I have been volunteering at the Kulbardi Aboriginal Centre. As a part of this position, I conduct one-on-one and group tutorial sessions in various areas, including Human Physiology, Exercise Physiology, Strength and Conditioning, Statistics, Psychology and Career Development. Due to my ongoing commitment to this program, I was offered a paid position as an Education Leader in 2022.
