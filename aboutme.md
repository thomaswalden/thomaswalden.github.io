title: About me
---
<div align="justify">Hi, my name is Thomas Walden. I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University Health Network, Toronto. My position is within the KITE Research Institute at the Lyndhurst Centre, focusing on movement rehabilitation for individuals with a spinal cord injury.</div>


<div align="justify">I completed my Ph.D. in Exercise Science at Murdoch University, Perth, Western Australia. My primary Ph.D. research investigated the biomechanical and physiological implications of lower limb blood flow restriction during treadmill walking. Relocating to Toronto in November 2022, I secured a postdoctoral research fellowship within the Craven Lab at Lyndhurst Rehabilitation Centre. Currently, my research focuses on implementing exoskeletons as a rehabilitation tool for individuals with an SCI/D, understanding independence post-rehabilitation discharge for individuals living with an SCI/D, and developing wearable technology to track movement patterns in older adults living with osteoporosis as a falls prevention strategy. My primary career goal is to develop novel training interventions to help remove participation barriers, allowing all individuals access to exercise’s health and fitness benefits.</div>

## Teaching Philosophy
The majority of my teaching experience has been within a classroom setting across numerous undergraduate courses, including Biomechanics, Human Physiology, Exercise Rehabilitation, Strength and Conditioning, Sport and Exercise Psychology, and Research Methodologies. I strongly believe in creating a safe and comfortable environment that allows students the opportunity to discuss the topics at hand. Interacting with their peers, explaining and listening to course content from many points of view facilitates a unique learning experience that fosters the beginning of a solid foundation of understanding. The idea stems from the convention of classroom autonomy, giving students a choice in discussion topics and direction, leading to substantially higher classroom participation. I also find that this technique quickly highlights areas that require additional focus, generating class content and discussion points for the following weeks, which directly focus on the needs of the specific class.

As a part of my role as a Ph.D. Candidate and Postdoctoral Fellow, I have had the opportunity to mentor undergraduate, masters, and Ph.D. level students. In these 1:1 situations, I take on the mentality of the age-old saying, 'Give a person a fish they eat for a day – teach them to fish, and they eat for life.' Providing sufficient resources, directed guidance, and clear expectations helps develop vital critical thinking skills, allowing these students to navigate specific issues that may arise during their research journey. I also believe this teaching process entices students to become lifelong learners in their chosen field. My priority is to help these junior researchers find their individual and unique voices for how they will pass on their skills and research findings in the future.
