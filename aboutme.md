title: About me

Hi, my name is Thomas Walden and I am a PhD Candidate at Murdoch University in Perth, Western Australia.

My PhD focuses on blood flow restricted walking. Specifically, my main research goal is to further understand the prescription parameters and safety elements of blood flow restricted walking. I am on a quest to determine whether blood flow restricted walking is a safe exercise modality for individuals that may already exhibit numerous risk factors for exercise. This would allow increased access to the benefits of exercise, removing a critical barrier to better health, improved fitness, and increased quality of life for all.
